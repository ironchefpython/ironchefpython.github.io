        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <p>I've been working with technology for 3/4 of my life, since my very 
        first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A">TI99/4A</a>,
        and everything about computing has changed except for my hunger to learn
        it all. I currently sling Visio and Powerpoint as Technology Architect 
        for an American bank. Having been put out to stud, I recall my
        development days with rose-colored glasses, and savor every chance I get
        I bang out a few thousand lines of code to solve an interesting problem.</p>
