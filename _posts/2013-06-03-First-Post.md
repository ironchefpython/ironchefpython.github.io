## A First post with Jekyll

On the long road from senior devloper to senior architect (which will eventually culminate in "senior citizen"), my focus has always been on educating myself. However, at this point my career path has led me to a point where there's little left to learn that will improve my productivity.

Rather than weep at the lack of new worlds to conquer, I will focus on two things: educating others and building tools. This is the move effecitve use of my spare time; having stood on the shoulders of giants, it's time to boost others up even higher on the pyramid.
