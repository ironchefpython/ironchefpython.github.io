## A First post with Jekyll

On the long road from senior devloper to senior architect (which will eventually
culminate in "senior citizen"), my focus has always been on educating myself.
However, at this point my career path has led me to a point where there's little
left to learn that will further my career.

Rather than weep at the lack of new worlds to conquer, I will focus on two 
things: educating others and building tools. This is the most effecitve use of 
my spare time; having stood on the shoulders of giants, it's time to boost 
others up even higher.
